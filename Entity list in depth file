local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-120 (3)", Content = "\n• Sadly, A-120 doesn't have a spawn/despawn noise, so you have to rely on the screenshake and ambience." ..
																	   "\n• Speaking of which, A-120's ambience sounds like 'an electric amp sound akin to distorted morse code', according to the wiki." ..

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-150 (2)", Content = "\n• A-150 checks all dark lockers in the room, so the best thing to do when you see the paper is to back out of the room you just loaded and wait for it to despawn."})
local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-150 (3)", Content = "\n• A-150's spawning and despawning audio sounds like squidward taking a step, its ambience sounds like a slighly distorted, high-pitched, photocopier sound, and the paper's despawning sequence just includes it slowly fading away as it makes a low-pitched paper-crumpling sound."})

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-183 (2)", Content = "\n• You can get out of your hiding place as A-183 rebounds back to room 1, but when it comes back and sees you out of your hiding place when it's roughly 500m or so away from you, it will scream and gain speed." ..
																	   "\n• After you make A-183 scream once, it won't do it again, rather it will keep rushing and kill you."})

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-200 (1)", Content = "\n• A-200 was stolen directly from 'Rooms', which is a large subsection from the original game, 'Rooms', by LSPLASH. (well not rly stolen, the owner of interminable rooms says he was inspired by rooms but whatever. Interminable Rooms' 'A-60' was as well so whetever.)" ..

																	   "\n• It's ambience sounds like cartoon wind, and its despawn sound just sounds like a loud whistling cartoon wind."})

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-245", Content = "\n• A-254 has no spawning sounds, but its ambience sounds like a really loud, low-pitched, buzzing light. Kind of like the backrooms level 0." ..
																   "\n• A-254 does no damage, so you don't need to hide, but it will break all dark lockers in the furthest loaded room. (including fridges)." ..
																   "\n• A-254 will despawn with 2 really bad guitar notes or smt."})

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-258", Content = "\n• A-258 spawns in the middle of a newly loaded room after room 258." ..
																   "\n• A-258 will just fuckin' be loud as shit so you can't hear other entities coming." ..
																   "\n• The best thing to do when it spawns is just hide until it despawns." ..

																   "\n• It spawns in the middle of the room and does no damage." ..

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-332 (2)", Content = "\n• once it is substantially far from any players, it will make an extremely loud hissing sound and despawn." ..

local Paragraph = Tab5:CreateParagraph({Title = "A-350", Content = "\n• A-350 has no spawning sound, but can be heard from far away, as its movement consist of traveling across roughly 2 rooms at once where it makes a weird bust of earrape." ..
																   "\n• A-350 will shoot bullets that change colors of red, blue, and green. It takes a while for it to get to room 350 because it spawns at room 1, but i still suggest hiding because the buillets are fast(ish)."})
